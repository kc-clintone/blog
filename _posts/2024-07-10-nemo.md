## Introduction

Welcome to Nemo, your go-to solution for comprehensive network scanning and monitoring. This project is designed to streamline the process of network management, making it accessible and efficient for professionals and enthusiasts alike. Over the past six months, I have worked tirelessly to bring Nemo to life, aiming to serve IT professionals, network administrators, and cybersecurity enthusiasts. My personal focus has been on ensuring seamless integration between various components and enhancing the user experience.

## Inspiration

Growing up in a tech-centric household, I was always surrounded by gadgets and networks. My father, an IT professional, often shared stories about network security and the challenges he faced. These stories piqued my interest, leading me to pursue a career in software engineering with a focus on cybersecurity. The idea for Nemo was born from a desire to create a tool that could simplify the complexities of network management, inspired by the countless hours I spent watching my father troubleshoot network issues. This project is a part of my portfolio for Holberton School, where I've been honing my skills to become a better engineer. [Learn more about Holberton School](link-to-holberton).

## About the Project

Nemo is a network scanning and monitoring tool designed for IT professionals and network administrators who need a reliable and comprehensive solution for managing network security and performance. My personal focus has been on creating a seamless integration of various functionalities and ensuring an intuitive user experience.

## Project Journey

For me, the inspiration to work on Nemo came from a personal connection to network security. Growing up in a tech-savvy household, I was always fascinated by my father’s work as an IT professional. I vividly remember the countless hours he spent managing network issues and the intricate processes he explained to me. These experiences fueled my passion for cybersecurity and motivated me to create a tool that could simplify network management.

During my time at Holberton School, I have been constantly pushed to innovate and think critically. Nemo was a natural extension of my desire to solve real-world problems using technology.

## Achievements

Through Nemo, I have successfully developed a comprehensive tool that offers:

- **Ping Sweep:** Easily scan IP ranges to identify active devices on the network.
- **Port Scanning:** Identify open ports and services running on them, with detailed service version detection.
- **Bandwidth Monitoring:** Monitor network usage in real-time to ensure optimal performance.
- **Latency Measurement:** Measure latency to various hosts to diagnose network issues quickly.

For the frontend, I opted to use HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to create a responsive and user-friendly interface. On the backend, I utilized Python and various libraries like `argparse` and `subprocess` for robust functionality. The decision to avoid additional frameworks was to deepen my understanding of core JavaScript and Python principles.

## Technical Challenges

One of the most challenging aspects of the project was integrating the service version detection in our port scanning feature. Initially, the `port_scan` function didn’t support this capability, which was crucial for providing detailed scan results.

**Situation:** I needed to implement service version detection to enhance our port scan results.  
**Task:** Modify the `port_scan` function to accept and process the `-sV` flag.  
**Action:** After researching nmap’s capabilities and syntax, I modified the `port_scan.py` script to append `-sV` to the scan arguments when the flag was provided. This involved understanding how nmap processes arguments and ensuring compatibility with our existing codebase.  
**Result:** With the updated `port_scan.py`, I successfully implemented service version detection, allowing users to get detailed information about the services running on scanned ports. This enhancement significantly improved the utility and accuracy of our scans, making Nemo a more powerful tool.

## Lessons Learned

Through this project, I have gained a deeper understanding of network security and the importance of comprehensive network management tools. The hands-on experience with Python, nmap, and various network protocols has been invaluable. I learned the importance of perseverance and problem-solving, and how different approaches can lead to innovative solutions. Moving forward, I am excited to apply these skills to more complex projects and continue exploring the field of cybersecurity.
